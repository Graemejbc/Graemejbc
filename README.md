- Hi, I’m @Graemejbc, you can call me Graeme!
- I’m interested in programming in general but am currently learning it exclusively for it's applications in Engineering.
- I’m currently learning Arduino (which I have past experience with) and C, which is new for me!!

I'm an engineering student at Queens in Ontario, Canada. In the future I hope to be an aerospace or nuclear engineer but for now I'm in a general program.
All of the coding I'll be doing at school will probably be control systems or have some relation to engineering.
On my profile I have some more fun, interesting programs back from highschool (games)!
